Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
What did you do particularly well?
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I chose the second project. The purpose of this project is to define the methods of the InvestmentCalculator class to evaluate and output
investment balances with/without monthly deposits.I think that I wrote my code in a condensed fashion. Security
would certainly be something that could be added if desired. I did not find this code particularly hard to write,
but it was a fun use of skills. I think that this entire project will be transferable to other projects and course
work within Computer Science. I used reliable comments and condensed code to make this program maintainable, 
readable, and adaptable.
